This colour pallete is from Barbershop Landing Page by Dmitry Lauretsky

### Typography 

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Montserrat - for headings

* Roboto - for paragraphs

### Imagery

For the background image I used a chees board image. The main purpose of this image is to give a dark background to the game. 

## Features

The Quiz Master is composed of 6 sections: the landing page, the categories page, the play area, the feedback page, the high score page and the rules page.

### Existing Features
#### The Landing Page

The landing page is the first page that the users see when they enter the website. It welcomes you to the Quiz Master. It has an input field where the user should put the username, a play button, a rules button and the high score button.

#### The Play Area

The Play area is the main area of the quiz, it is where the users test their knowledge. At the top of the page are the score, the timer and the question number. In the middle you have the question and below it the 4 answers that you can choose from. If the selected answer is correct the button turns green and 10 points are added to the score. If it is wrong, the button turns red. If the timer reaches 0, it moves on to the next question.

### Future Features

Future implementations are:
* Two more categories would be added: art/literature and music/cinema.
* Every category has its own background, related to the category.
* A positive sound for the right answer and a sad sound for the wrong one. The player could change the volume or turn it off. 
* When the wrong answer is chosen, the right answer will turn green. So that the player gets the chance to learn what the right answer is. 
* A high score per category. 
* Add more questions to every catgory. So that frequent players still get diverse questions.
